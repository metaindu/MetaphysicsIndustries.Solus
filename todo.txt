unify the namespace
    so that `vars` and `delete` and friends all work consistently and
    predictably
don't evaluate macros while parsing
don't require the SolusEnvironment while parsing
arbitrary rules for function arguments, e.g.:
    - like GreaterThanZero or
    - Matrix sized NxM
    - multiplication operator require that subsequent matrix arguments have
      matching inner dimensions, to perform typical matrix multiplication
similar checks on inputs to expression
a type system to support the above
maybe a "property system" in addition to, or in place of, said type system
markers of the type of the result of an expression (or return value of a
    function), based on inputs
simple sets and intervals as IMathObject
more complicated expression-based sets
complex numbers
tensors of rank 3 or more
    including syntax
boolean true and false
piece-wise functions
parametric expressions, e.g. "sin(x) for 0<=x<2*pi" or "dist(r) for r in R"
    parameters
        varref '=' '[' expr '..' expr ']'
        expr ('<'|'<=') varref ('<'|'<=') expr
        varref 'in' expr
        varref ('<'|'<='|'>='|'>') expr
        expr ('<'|'<='|'>='|'>') expr
sum function that can operate on parametrics. the big sigma symbol.
single component assignment?
    "c[2,3] := 4"
parametric array assignment
    "c[i,j] := sum(a[i][k]*b[k][j] for k=[0..n-1]) for i=[0..m-1],j=[0..p-1]"
    possible ambiguity:
        1 for i=... for j=...
        (1 for i=...) for j=...
        1 for i=(... for j=...)
    possible ambiguity:
        1 for i=... for j=...,k=...
        (1 for i=...) for j=...,k=...
        1 for i=(... for j=...),k=...
        1 for i=(... for j=...,k=...)
    a[i,j] := f(i,j) for i=[0..7],j=[0..7]   ?
    b := f(i,j) for i=[0..7],j=[0..7]   ?
    a[i,j] := b   ???
parametric array literals
    [ f(i,j) for i=[0..7],j=[0..7] ]   ???
    the comma may be ambiguous: does it separate intervals or array elements?

syntax for user-defined functions
    type checks/requirements
    return types
    docstrings
    `f(a:scalar) "calculate the thing" -> vector := [a, a+1, a+2]`
repl line continuation, so it doesn't all have to go on a single line
    wodehouse can do that, but that's python, so not much help
