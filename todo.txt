proper exception type and consistent error handling
unify the namespace
    so that `vars` and `delete` and friends all work consistently and
    predictably
don't evaluate macros while parsing
don't require the SolusEnvironment while parsing
arbitrary rules for function arguments, e.g.:
    - like GreaterThanZero or
    - Matrix sized NxM
    - multiplication operator require that subsequent matrix arguments have
      matching inner dimenions, to perform typical matrix multiplication
similar checks on inputs to expression
a type system to support the above
maybe a "property system" in addition to, or in place of, said type system
markers of the type of the result of an expression (or return value of a
    function), based on inputs
simple sets and intervals as IMathObject
more complicated expression-based sets
complex numbers
tensors of rank 3 or more
boolean true and false
piece-wise functions
